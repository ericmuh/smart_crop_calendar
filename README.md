# Theme: Meteorological and weather information Systems Coupled With Crop Calendar.

Note: Our project is in it early development stages. Not much as been done however we have a documment wire design that i will share with you below.

In this android repository: We use Android Studio as our IDE and Kotlin Programing language.
## Build Type or variants
debug, staging, release

This project is a data drive project, where sensors will collect data, that our appis will consume. The data we intend to collect is about climate, farmer seasons, which crops they are planting for that season, about soil on which thise plants will be grown. The sensor will be calibrated to pic data every after 30 minutes. The coleceted data will be analysed at our server side and then computationn will be carried out and availed to the different agricultural stakeholders especialy farmers.

Here is the link that simulates how we will pick data from sensors: https://github.com/EmmaSemutenga/smart_crop_calendar

Below are some of the screens shorts that will make up our project for the smart phone apps.

Farmer Profile
- Farmer can add more than one farm.
- Data will be collected from the different farms
- Each might have a different  crop season, basing on the soil water content and threshold, inputs like fertilizers etc.
- Basing on the collected and its computations, farmers actions will guide in regard to agriculture practices.
